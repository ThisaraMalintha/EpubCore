# Epub CLI

In order to make it as easy as possible to manipulate epub files with little / no programming knowledge, I've created the `epub` cli (command line interface) tool. You can install and run this tool from your command line / bash prompt to read / write changes to epub files.

## Prerequisites

`.NET 7.0` or greater

## How to install from the interwebs

`dotnet tool install EpubCore.Cli`

## How to install from this repo

If you are doing development work, it's easier to test if you just install from your local branch and run it up from there.  Super simple pwsh to make this possible for  ya.

`pwsh install-cli-local.ps1`


## Usage
